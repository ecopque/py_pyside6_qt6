#Definition QApplication: It's a main class of Qt that manages the application's execution. It takes care of initializing the application, defining global properties and behaviors, as well as managing input/output events. It's an essential part of any Qt application.
#Definition QPushButton: It's a class that represents a clickable button in a user interface. It can display text or an icon and can be clicked by the user to trigger a specific action. It's used to create buttons in Qt applications.
#1: This imports the sys module, which provides access to some variables used or maintained by the interpreter and functions that heavily interact with the interpreter. In this case, we're using it to access sys.argv, which are the arguments passed to the Python script from the command line.
#2: This line imports the QApplication and QPushButton classes from the QtWidgets module of the PySide6 library.
#3: This line creates an instance of the QApplication class, passing sys.argv as an argument. sys.argv is a list of command line arguments.
#4: Here, we're creating an instance of the QPushButton class with the label 'Click here!' for the button.
#5: This line sets the style of the button. In this case, we're setting the font size to 40 pixels and the text color to blue.
#6: This displays the button on the screen.
#7: This starts the event loop of the application, allowing the application to respond to events such as button clicks, mouse movement, etc. This function only returns when the application is terminated.
